# My Blog Post
## This is my blog post
step one: learn to use yamlchop
two: apply my twists on the gpt api hits
    A hit that checks generated content for logical fallacies
    A hit that check content for Allegorical and Litteral perspectives respectivly
    A hit that attempts to accellerate the dialectic and steelman opposing views
    A hit that builds out Trees based on the request for dividng topics up into schollarly course curriculum with telescopic extensibility of scope.
